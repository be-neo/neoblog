# Contributing to Neoblog

First off, thank you for wanting to contribute to our project.

This is space is still a huge WIP, so is this document. Our apologies, but with new contributions will come lessons learned and updated info.

For now, here are some of the conventions we've cooked up:
* use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), you can see in our [readme](https://github.com/be-neo/neoblog/blob/master/README.md) how we define Major and Minor changes
* use [Semantic Commit Messages](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages), this makes it easier to figure what your commit changed later on
* always use a feature or fix branch resp. for new features and bugfixes
* Since Neoblog is a monorepo, use the package name as a subfolder for your feature branch like this: feature/smart-contract/serialization
* Use the issue number in your fix branch like this: fix/26-routing
* use soft tabs (2 spaces)
