# Neoblog smart contract(s)

We will be using Python to write our smart contract(s) that will be needed to develop the Neoblog platform.

The initial aim is that a single smart contract should suffice, but multiple contracts are not excluded.

The current phase will be tested on a private network.

Current smart contract script hash is: baa0da3f8d3b4657d9a3e650e7f7aa11045970e8
